# Calabash-anodroid-POC
This is just a proof of concept for calabash- cucumber that I have done for test app.

1. Pre-requisite 

 Install ruby https://rubyinstaller.org/downloads/ and gem

The solution have a gem file that holds the dependencies for this project.

Run - 'bundle install' command to install all dependency or you can choose to install the depencencies individually 

gem 'calabash-android'

gem 'cucumber'
